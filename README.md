## Election-Audit Summary

  What you have here is a well put together script that will meet your requirements at a top satisfactory level for the foreseeable future. If you choose
to do buisness with us then I would like to add a bonus to this proposal. That bonus would be, if you guys ever feel like this script is no longer exceeding 
your expectations, then we would be more than happy to come back, at no cost, and make the necessary changes to make this organization happy with our product.

With that being said, I'd would like to inform you on how versitile this script is. For example, if you'd like to use this scirpt internally, you can.
You can make the necessary changes within the script to maybe take a vote on new changes within departments. We would change the "candidates" in the script
to, "ideas", and the "counties" to "department names".
Another example; You can make changes within the script to see which areas of QoL (Qualit of Life) need improvement. You can swap the candidates name with
tech fresh, office supplies, etc. You would then run the script and it would determine the most voted selection.
The possibilites are endless. These were just a few that we came up with on the spot. Imagine what other uses we'd be able to come up with with more time.

We hope that with what we have presented you with today, that you will choose us to ensure this buisness continues to grow in the right direction. Thank you 
for your time and this opportunity.
